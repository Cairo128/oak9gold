<p> Hi my name is Cairo, I love to watch anime, read manga, play video games, draw, and share what I enjoy with others.</p>
<br> 
<p>With the knowledge I've gained on coding and creating your own website I'd like to make a site where you generate a random anime to watch or see the manga or anime that I reccomend</p>
